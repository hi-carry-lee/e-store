# Routing and Authentication Guide

## Route Structure
The application uses Next.js App Router with the following route groups:
- `/(root)` - Public-facing store pages
- `/(auth)` - Authentication-related pages
- `/admin` - Admin dashboard and management
- `/user` - User account and settings
- `/api` - Backend API endpoints

## Authentication
Authentication is handled by NextAuth.js with the following key files:
- [auth.ts](mdc:auth.ts) - Main authentication configuration
- [auth.config.ts](mdc:auth.config.ts) - Auth options and callbacks
- [middleware.ts](mdc:middleware.ts) - Route protection middleware

## Protected Routes
- Admin routes (`/admin/*`) require admin role
- User routes (`/user/*`) require authentication
- API routes are protected using the middleware

## Authentication Flow
1. Users can sign in through `/sign-in`
2. Authentication state is managed by NextAuth.js
3. Protected routes are handled by middleware
4. Unauthorized access redirects to `/unauthorized`
