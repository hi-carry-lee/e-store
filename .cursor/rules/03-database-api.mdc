# Database and API Structure

## Database Setup
The application uses Prisma ORM with a relational database:
- [prisma/schema.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema.prisma) - Database schema definition
- [db/index.ts](mdc:db/index.ts) - Database client and utilities

## API Routes
API routes are organized under `app/api` following REST principles:
- `/api/auth/*` - Authentication endpoints
- `/api/products/*` - Product management
- `/api/orders/*` - Order processing
- `/api/users/*` - User management

## Data Access
- Database operations are abstracted through Prisma Client
- API routes use server actions for mutations
- Data fetching uses Next.js server components
- Real-time updates handled through webhooks

## Error Handling
- API routes follow consistent error response format
- Database errors are properly caught and handled
- Validation is performed using Zod schemas
- Error boundaries catch and display UI errors
